# TwitchDropsMaster

A Windows application that automatically watches Twitch streams and claims drop rewards for you. No additional steps needed—just download and start using.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/phaoer/TwitchDropsMaster.git
```

**The application does not include network acceleration features. Please ensure you can access [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) before using it.**

## Features

- Fully automated: Automatically watches live streams and claims rewards.
- Waiting mechanism: If no streamers are live for a game you like, TwitchDropsMaster will keep searching until a streamer goes live or you switch to a different game with active drops.

## Future

- Queue mechanism: You can add multiple games to the queue at once, and TwitchDropsMaster will complete drop claiming one by one, unless the drop event for a game ends.
